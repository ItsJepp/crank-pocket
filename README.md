# Crank Pocket
I decided to get a Playdate for game development practice after it was shown on Back Pocket. It made sense to create something to submit as an "ad" to the show. This is the result as it appears in the ad.

Here's the ad: https://youtu.be/RhDU-hct25U?t=5189

The original code was intended to be minimum effort to produce what I needed for the ad, which is my justification for some lazy inclusions. ðŸ˜‚ I did end up having to garbage collect the objects flying off screen, as the limited capabilities of the Playdate made it struggle fairly quickly if I left them "drawing" off-screen.

Hope you enjoy!
